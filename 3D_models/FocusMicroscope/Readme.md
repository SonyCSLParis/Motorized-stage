# 3D design for the autofocus component

The autofocus module is based on the small linear slider found, among other, on Amazon ([French site](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B08Y6VZMC8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1), [US site](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Linear+Rail+50mm+nema11&crid=AHAYTX9E18IR&sprefix=linear+rail+50mm+nema%2Caps%2C635&ref=nb_sb_noss)).

The current 3D design uses [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/).

The main files are:

* FocusMicroscope.scad: The main file that bundles the different components together.
* Structure.scad: The components of the focus module.
* LinearSlider.scad: 3D model of the linear slider.
* UC2.scad: A 3D model of the UC2 cube.
