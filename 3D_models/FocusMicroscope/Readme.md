# 3D design for the autofocus component

The autofocus module is based on the small linear slider found, among other, on Amazon ([French site](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B08Y6VZMC8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1), [US site](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Actuator-Stepper-Milling-Machine/dp/B07K7FQ245/ref=sr_1_4)).

The current 3D design uses [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/).

The main files are:

* FocusMicroscope.scad: The main file that bundles the different components together.
* Structure.scad: The components of the focus module.
* LinearSlider.scad: 3D model of the linear slider.
* UC2.scad: A 3D model of the UC2 cube.
